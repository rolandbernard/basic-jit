x86-64 JIT for BASIC
=================
This is a small JIT compiler for a version of the BASIC programming language.

This JIT has only been testet on a x86-64 machine running GNU+Linux.
In addition to this, multiple instructions (e.g. BELL or TAB) require the terminal to
support some of the ANSI escape sequences.
